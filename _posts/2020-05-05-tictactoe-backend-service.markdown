I am going to be developing a single and 2 player tictactoe game playable on the browser. The expected features include:

1. Google id based login.
3. unbeatable tictactoe single player.
4. https.
5. show online players.
6. ability for two player play (invitations and realtime communications).
7. Backend will be deployed an aws and can be scaled as and when necessary.
8. full ci cd pipeline for deployments.
9. Scores against players and computer will be stored in db.

The backend will be based on Java since I am comfortable with that. The other technicalities of the project will be decided after I learn a little more about what aws has to offer.
